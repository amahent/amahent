# Hi, I'm an undergraduate in Geophysics in Brazil

My main interest is working at the intersection of **subsurface data analysis** and **machine learning**, with broad interest in **geostatistics**.

This profile showcases my academic and applied projects, from **predictive modeling of mineral occurrences** using real-world **geophysical data** to exploratory analysis of complex, **multivariate dataset**s. I work mainly with open-source tools and public datasets (e.g., CPRM, ANP).

With a background in Earth sciences and quantitative modeling, my experience bridges **spatial data analysis, exploratory statistics, supervised machine learning, geophysical & geological processing data and open geodata workflows**.

I have worked with **airborne magnetometry, gamma-ray spectrometry, borehole data, lithologies, faults, and structural features** to build interpretable ML models and data visualizations.
