# Hi, I'm an undergraduate in Geophysics in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil

I'm an undergraduate in Geophysics working at the intersection of **subsurface data analysis** and **machine learning**, with broad interest in data science for geosciences.

This profile showcases my academic and applied projects, from predictive modeling of mineral occurrences using real-world geophysical data to exploratory analysis of complex, multivariate datasets. I work mainly with open-source tools and public datasets (e.g., CPRM, ANP).

With a background in Earth sciences and quantitative modeling, my experience bridges spatial data analysis, exploratory statistics, supervised machine learning, geophysical & geological processing data and open geodata workflows.

I have worked with airborne magnetometry, gamma-ray spectrometry, borehole data, lithologies, faults, and structural features to build interpretable ML models and data visualizations.
